FR No.	Functional Requirement (Epic)	Sub Requirement (Story / Sub-Task)
FR-1	User Registration	Registration through Form.
Registration through Gmail.
FR-2	User uploads the images in the page	The historiographic Images are fed in the webpage.
FR-3	User Results	The Prediction is appeared in the webpage.

Non-functional Requirements:
Following are the non-functional requirements of the proposed solution.
FR No.	Non-Functional Requirement	Description
NFR-1	Usability	The application interface of the model is highly user-friendly. By ensuring an intuitive and accessible user interface, customizability, integration with existing systems, and fast and accurate performance, healthcare providers can maximize the benefits of the AI model and improve patient outcomes.
NFR-2	Security	The security of a breast cancer detection AI model can be ensured through a combination of data privacy, model security, regular updates, and regular security assessments. The data to be fed in the model is uploaded and processed in a secure manner.
NFR-3	Reliability	By ensuring high-quality training data, robust algorithms, thorough validation and testing, seamless integration with clinical workflows, and ongoing monitoring and refinement, healthcare providers can ensure that the model is reliable and produces accurate and consistent results.
NFR-4	Performance	The AI model is efficient and provides accurate results detecting the type of the tumour.
NFR-5	Availability	The model is reachable and attainable to everyone irrespective of their location.
NFR-6	Scalability	The webpage is scalable to support high network traffic. The AI model can handle increasing volumes of data and workloads while maintaining accuracy and performance.
